# Project

This repository is managed with [swamp](https://github.com/swamp-club/swamp).

## Rules

1. **Search before you build.** When automating AWS, APIs, or any external service: (a) search community extensions with `swamp extension search <query>` — prefer `@swamp/*` official extensions first, (b) search local/installed types with `swamp model type search <query>`, (c) if a community extension exists, install it with `swamp extension pull <package>` instead of building from scratch, (d) extend an existing type if it covers the domain but lacks the method you need, (e) only create a custom extension model in `extensions/models/` as a last resort. Use the `swamp` skill for guidance. The `command/shell` model is ONLY for ad-hoc one-off shell commands, NEVER for wrapping CLI tools or building integrations.
2. **Extend, don't be clever.** When a model covers the domain but lacks the method you need, extend it with `export const extension` — don't bypass it with shell scripts, CLI tools, or multi-step hacks. One method, one purpose. Use `swamp model type describe <type> --json` to check available methods.
3. **Use the data model.** Once data exists in a model (via `lookup`, `start`, `sync`, etc.), reference it with CEL expressions. Don't re-fetch data that's already available.
4. **CEL expressions everywhere.** Wire models together with CEL expressions. Always prefer `data.latest("<name>", "<dataName>").attributes.<field>` over the deprecated `model.<name>.resource.<spec>.<instance>.attributes.<field>` pattern.
5. **Verify before destructive operations.** Always `swamp model get <name> --json` and verify resource IDs before running delete/stop/destroy methods.
6. **Prefer fan-out methods over loops.** When operating on multiple targets, use a single method that handles all targets internally (factory pattern) rather than looping N separate `swamp model method run` calls against the same model. Multiple parallel calls against the same model contend on the per-model lock, causing timeouts. A single fan-out method acquires the lock once and produces all outputs in one execution. Check `swamp model type describe` for methods that accept filters or produce multiple outputs.
7. **Extension npm deps are bundled, not lockfile-tracked.** Swamp's bundler inlines all npm packages (except zod) into extension bundles at bundle time. `deno.lock` and `package.json` do NOT cover extension model dependencies — this is by design. Always pin explicit versions in `npm:` import specifiers (e.g., `npm:lodash-es@4.17.21`).
8. **Reports for reusable data pipelines.** When the task involves building a repeatable pipeline to transform, aggregate, or analyze model output (security reports, cost analysis, compliance checks, summaries), create a report extension. Use the `swamp` skill for guidance.
9. **"Workflow" means a swamp workflow.** In this repository the word "workflow" (and "create/run/execute/validate/debug workflow", "automate", "orchestrate", "automated/nightly job") refers to a swamp workflow — a declarative YAML DAG of model-method steps authored via `swamp workflow create`. Load and follow the `swamp` skill for these requests. Do NOT interpret these as a request to build an agent task list, spin up worktrees, or schedule a cron/remote agent. Only use those orchestration mechanisms when the user explicitly names one (e.g. "task list", "subagent", "worktree", "cron", "remote agent") or explicitly asks you to do the work yourself step by step rather than author a swamp workflow.

## Skills

**IMPORTANT:** Always load swamp skills, even when in plan mode. The skills provide
essential context for working with this repository.

- `swamp` - Swamp CLI — models, workflows, data, vaults, extensions, publishing, repos, reports, issues, and troubleshooting
- `swamp-getting-started` - Interactive onboarding for new swamp users

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** At the start of every conversation, run
`swamp model search --json`. If no models are returned (empty result), you MUST
immediately invoke the `swamp-getting-started` skill before doing anything else.
This walks new users through an interactive onboarding tutorial.

If models already exist, start by using the `swamp` skill to work with
swamp models.

## Commands

Use `swamp --help` to see available commands. For a machine-readable JSON
schema of the CLI (commands, options, arguments) intended for agent
consumption, run `swamp help [<command>...]` — e.g. `swamp help` returns
the full tree, and `swamp help model method run` scopes to a subtree.

## Repository Layout

This is a monorepo of publishable swamp extensions following the
[swamp-club/swamp-extensions](https://github.com/swamp-club/swamp-extensions)
pattern.

```
model/<name>/          # One directory per publishable extension
  manifest.yaml        # paths.base: manifest; models listed as bare filenames
  <model>.ts           # Model source (flat alongside manifest)
  <helpers>.ts         # Helper modules (listed in additionalFiles)
  <model>_test.ts      # Tests
  deno.json            # Per-extension fmt/lint/test config
  README.md
  LICENSE.txt
extensions/models/     # Only upstream_extensions.json lives here (pulled extension lockfile)
.claude/skills/        # Skills for Claude Code (swamp, swamp-wheelshop, etc.)
```

### Creating a new extension

1. `mkdir model/<name>` and add source files flat in that directory
2. Create `deno.json` (copy from any existing `model/*/deno.json`)
3. Run `swamp-wheelshop` before hand-rolling non-trivial logic
4. **Write tests first** (`*_test.ts`) — define schemas and expected behaviors before implementation
5. Implement the model to satisfy the tests
6. Create `manifest.yaml` with `paths: { base: manifest }` and `models:` as bare filenames
7. Run checks from the extension dir: `deno fmt --check && deno lint && deno task test`
8. Push: `cd model/<name> && swamp extension push manifest.yaml --json`

### Testing published extensions

Pull into the root workspace (no type conflicts since source lives in `model/`):
```bash
swamp extension pull @bixu/<name>
```
